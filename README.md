# The Group Formation Algorithm
 
## About
 This bachelor project is aiming to generate fair teams for an annual church camp based on the skills that the users have inputted themselves through a Google form.

The algorithm is to output five teams with the use of the different constraints it has been given.

You can read more about the project and how we handle the data: [link](https://camp.cbmbc.org/group-form)

## How to start the project


Create a virtual environment with the python version 3.10
```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

On macOS and Linux
```bash 
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

To run the Python script with a file as input, use the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py --input <path/to/file>
```

### Required Packages  

The dependencies for this project are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file.  

### Optimization Solvers

To solve optimization problems, you can use either **CBC** (an open-source solver) or **Gurobi** (a commercial solver).  
Please note that **Gurobi** requires a valid license.

### Gurobi License

To use Gurobi, you must obtain a **Gurobi license**.  
Instructions for acquiring a license can be found on their [official website](https://www.gurobi.com/).


## Additional Notes

To create a virtual environment, run the following command
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
